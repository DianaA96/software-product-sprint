            <p class="normalText">First of all, I would like to introduce myself more properly. As I said, I am Diana and I was born in Mexico City 24 years ago. I live in a very small town called Temascalapa, located at the north of the State of Mexico. I am a sophomore majoring Computer Science at Tec de Monterrey in Mexico.</p>
            <p class="normalText">I studied at university some years ago to become an English teacher! I really loved education, so I decided to start studying CS to come to reach more people through technologies. We've already seen how important is to be prepared for emergencies, isn't it?</p>
