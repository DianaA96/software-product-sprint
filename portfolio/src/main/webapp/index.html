I live in a very small town called Temascalapa, located at the north of the State of Mexico. I am a sophomore majoring Computer Science at Tec de Monterrey in Mexico.</p>
                <p class="normalText">I studied at university some years ago to become an English teacher! I really loved education, so I decided to start studying CS to come to reach more people through technologies. We've already seen how important is to be prepared for emergencies, isn't it?</p>

                    <p>I love photographing nature and taking people's portraits. I reckon that all those portraits taken naturally, are the most beautiful ones, and help us to keep real and intense momentsâœ¨. Buildings and streets have also their own magic thing.</p>
                    <p>But, sometimes, photos just happen. Without planning them. And they are incredible, and thank God we have Google PhotosðŸŽ‰.</p>

                    <p>I learned how to read when I was three. I was a little child and I did not have any siblings. For those reasons, my parents purchased, for years and years, a biiiiiig bunch of books and magazines for me.</p>
                    <p>My mother is also very passionate about reading and writing. She likes wondering about new stories all the time. Her imagination is incredibly vast and powerful! So, maybe, I inherited that talent, who knows?</p>
                    <p>I adore writing as much as I love reading! I could spend hours and hours writing about so many things. And I tend to be extremely picky when it comes to spelling in Spanish :(. I understand that, somerimes, I can be very annoying. But it was extremely useful when I was an active teacher!</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, I include this as a hidden talent because it is the only one I have, I guess. And also because I am not an active writer, even though I would like to do so in the future!</p>
